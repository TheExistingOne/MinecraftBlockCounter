# World Scanner
This tool uses [Amulet Core](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-Core) to scan a selected area for a set of blocks and save the number of that number of blocks found by y-level.

## Setup
 - Install the libraries listed in requirements.txt
 - Copy your world file into the working directory
 - Set your settings in the config.yaml file
 - Run the CheckDist.py program
 - There should now be a .csv file for every block you selected in the results folder now
 - That's it!
